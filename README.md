### Javascript-based Team Game

A two-player cooperative game, where incoming obstacles must be dodged to earn a high score. Rather than competing against an opponent, players must work together and coordinate path routes to stay alive.

Each player controls a single orb. The player's orbs are linked together by a beam that must stay out of the path of incoming blocks. The longer the beam stays uninterrupted, the higher the score achieved, and the harder the game gets.

## Controls

Player 1 moves their orb up, left, down, and right with the W,A,S,D keys respectively.

Player 2 moves their orb up, left, down, and right with the arrow keys respectively.

# User Stories

As a player, I have the option of playing the game without a partner, so that I can enjoy it solo when there's no-one to play with.

As a player, I feel the game's difficulty level increase over time, so that there is added value to a higher score.

As a player, I can control the game with one hand so that another player can be sitting at the same keyboard to play simultanously and comfortably.

As a player, when losing the game, I'm prompted to play again with a single keystroke so that I can start over without having to refresh the page, and so that I can take my time in starting over.

As a player, I experience collision detection with the bounds of the game window, so that my orb(s) doesn't get lost off-screen.

### Future implementations

As a player, I can enter my name before playing, so that the experience of scoring high is more personalized on-screen.

As a player, I can share my score on major social networks to get friends interested in playing the game.
