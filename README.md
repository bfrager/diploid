### Javascript-based Team Game


A two-player cooperative game, where incoming obstacles must be dodged to earn a high score. Rather than competing against an opponent, players must work together and coordinate path routes to stay alive.

Each player controls a single orb. The player's orbs are linked together by a beam that must stay out of the path of incoming blocks. The longer the beam stays uninterrupted, the higher the score achieved, and the harder the game gets.
